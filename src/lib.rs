//! Progress Tracking Helper Crate
//!
//! This crate helps you in cases where you need to track when a bunch of
//! work has been completed, and perform a state transition.
//!
//! The most typical use case are loading screens, where you might need to
//! load assets, prepare the game world, etcâ€¦ and then transition to the
//! in-game state when everything is done.
//!
//! However, this crate is general, and could also be used for any number of
//! other things, even things like cooldowns and animations.
//!
//! To use this plugin, add one or more instances `ProgressPlugin` to your
//! `App`, configuring for the relevant states.
//!
//! Implement your tasks as regular Bevy systems that return a `Progress`
//! and add them to your respective state(s) using `.track_progress()`.
//!
//! The return value indicates how much progress a system has completed so
//! far. It specifies the currently completed "units of work" as well as
//! the expected total.
//!
//! When all registered systems return a progress value where `done >= total`,
//! your desired state transition will be performed automatically.
//!
//! If you need to access the overall progress information (say, to display a
//! progress bar), you can get it from the `ProgressCounter` resource.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! There is also an optional feature (`assets`) implementing basic asset
//! loading tracking. Just add your handles to the `AssetsLoading` resource.
//!
//! If you need something more advanced, I recommend the `bevy_asset_loader`
//! crate, which now has support for integrating with this crate. :)
